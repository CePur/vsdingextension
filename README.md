Visual Studio Ding extension

====================================================

This small extension will play notification sounds when following events occur:
- Build Complete
- Entering debugger mode (breakpoint hit, etc)
- Unit tests finished to run

Useful when working with big solutions or when build/test run/hitting a breakpoint takes a lot of time and developer can be distructed on other things while he waits.

This is an open source project, join!

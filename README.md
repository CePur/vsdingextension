Visual Studio Ding extension

====================================================

This small extension will play notification sounds when following events occur:
- Build Complete
- Entering debugger mode (breakpoint hit, etc)
- Unit tests finished to run

Ability to toggle when the notifications sound can be found in the Visual Studio Options under 'Ding'

Useful when working with big solutions or when build/test run/hitting a breakpoint takes a lot of time and developer can be distructed on other things while he waits.

This is an open source project, join!
